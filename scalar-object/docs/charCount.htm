    <p><strong>Example #1 charCount() example</strong></p>
    <pre class="php-code">
      <?php

    <div>The above example will output:</div>

      There were 2 instance(s) of "T" in the string.
      There were 1 instance(s) of "a" in the string.
      There were 1 instance(s) of "d" in the string.
      There were 1 instance(s) of "e" in the string.
      There were 2 instance(s) of "n" in the string.
      There were 2 instance(s) of "o" in the string.
