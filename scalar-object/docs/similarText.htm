<h1>similarText</h1>

 <div>
  <p>
   This calculates the similarity between two strings as described in
   Programming Classics: Implementing the World&#039;s Best Algorithms by Oliver (ISBN 0-131-00413-1). Note that this implementation does not use a
   stack as in Oliver&#039;s pseudo code, but recursive calls which may or may not
   speed up the whole process. Note also that the complexity of this algorithm
   is O(N**3) where N is the length of the longest string.
